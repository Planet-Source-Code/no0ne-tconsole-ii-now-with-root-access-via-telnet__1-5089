Tconsole II, Now with ROOT access Via Telnet.
Due to the requests for Directory Surfing to be added. Well here it is. The DOS Prompt Via Telnet. After given this some thought. I didn't want to re-create DOS, BUT the Prompt that DOS does use is it's directory structure. SO, here it is . DOS Mode Via Telnet. Supports the basic commands ( dir ) for a listing of  files and folders on the remote drive,  ( cd  ) for changing of the directory, even checks to see if valid folder. There are DOS menus to help you get around. PLUS all the old stuff that was included in ver.-1.01... I.E. (Reboot the remote machine, Restart Tconsole, View system resources [ i.e. memory, processor, ext., ext. ], Send test print pages, View console log, Can 'get' or view any ASCII file [i.e. win.ini or config.sys], You can even SPAWN PROCESSES ( Start a remote application).  SPAWING and the GET command have to be issued from the Standard Telnet Mode. This wasn't designed to be a Remote OS. :)
See the Readme.txt for further information.

This is only a BETA version.

If you have any problems in telnet. make sure to turn local echo OFF, and turn BUFFERS up to around 256. other wise type in 127.0.0.1 for remote server and have fun.... ;)
