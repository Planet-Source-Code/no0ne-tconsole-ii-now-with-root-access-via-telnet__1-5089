### Description

Due to the requests for Directory Surfing to be added. Well here it is. The DOS Prompt Via Telnet. After given this some thought. I didn't want to re-create DOS, BUT the Prompt that DOS does use is it's directory structure. SO, here it is . DOS Mode Via Telnet. Supports the basic commands ( dir ) for a listing of files and folders on the remote drive, ( cd ) for changing of the directory, even checks to see if valid folder. There are DOS menus to help you get around............ PLUS all the old stuff that was included in ver. 1.01.. Tconsole is a telnet server which allows control to a remote computer. This was put together as part of a Network Administrators Tool Kit. Threw TELNET

services, from any platform (UNIX/Mac). You can (Reboot the remote machine , Restart Tconsole , View system resources [ i.e memory, processor, ext, ext

], Send test print pages, View console log, Can 'get' or view any ASCII file [i.e win.ini or config.sys], You can even SPAWN PROCESSES ( Start a remote

application ). This will only SPAWN windows apps, Due to security and further testing. The use of passing arguments to programs has been disabled. But

can easly be changed to do so. THE SERVER SUPPORTS: Full configuration with reads/writes to Tconsole.ini as needed. Uses auto start for access after

reboot, Has view panel for monitoring server traffic. Supports blocking of multiple Failed login attempts, With full logging of process both server and from the

remote telnet session. Uses Menus for easy navigation with telnet. Has instruction menu's for 'GET' and 'SPAWN'. Even uses the Classic UNIX bash prompt.

;)..See the Readme.txt for further information.
